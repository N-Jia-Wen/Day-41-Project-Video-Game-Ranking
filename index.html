<h3>Honkai Star Rail</h3>
<p>The game I play the most right now. The story is interesting, and there are fun events to play too. The autoplay feature is also useful to avoid burnout.</p>
<br />
<h3>Splatoon 3</h3>
<p>Fun PvP game to spend your time on. It's very competitive, and the developers spice things up with new seasonal weapons and events.</p>
<br />
<h3>Pokemon Scarlet & Violet</h3>
<p>Despite the less than stellar graphics and framerate, I thoroughly liked the open world trajectory that the Pokemon series is heading towards. I also liked the extra gameplay in the DLC (though it's definitely not worth the price tag).</p>
